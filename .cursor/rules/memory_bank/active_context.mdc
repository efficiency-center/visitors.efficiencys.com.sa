# Active Context: Current Operations Snapshot

## Current Focus
The project is in its initial implementation phase. The core HTML wrapper page has been created and is functional. The system is ready for local testing and further UI enhancements if needed.

## Recent Changes
- Project description has been enhanced with comprehensive details
- Memory bank structure has been fully established and documented
- All 6 core memory bank files created (project_brief, product_context, active_context, system_patterns, tech_context, progress)
- Devlog directory created for future issue documentation
- Local development server has been set up for testing

## Immediate Next Steps
1. ✅ Memory bank documentation - COMPLETED
2. Verify local server functionality and test the application
3. Test responsive design on various devices (if needed)
4. Consider any UI enhancements or customizations (optional)
5. Prepare for production deployment to visitors.efficiencys.com.sa

## Active Decisions
- **Architecture**: Using iframe embedding approach for Google Apps Script integration (maintained)
- **Styling**: Dark theme (#0b0b0b) selected for professional appearance (maintained)
- **Responsiveness**: Full viewport approach with mobile-optimized viewport settings (maintained)

## Pending Questions for User
- Are there any specific UI customizations desired (headers, footers, branding)?
- Are there any additional features needed beyond the current registration check?
- Are there any specific browser compatibility requirements?
- Is there a need for loading indicators or error handling UI?

## Current State Summary
- **Status**: Functional and ready for use
- **Deployment**: Ready for deployment to `visitors.efficiencys.com.sa`
- **Testing**: Local server available at `http://localhost:8000`
- **Documentation**: Complete (memory bank fully established)

## Critical Considerations for Next Actions
- Any UI changes must not affect iframe functionality
- Google Apps Script URL must remain unchanged
- Responsive design must be preserved in all modifications
- Dark theme consistency should be maintained

## Temporary State
- Local development server running in background (port 8000)
- Project structure minimal (single HTML file)
- No additional dependencies or build processes required
