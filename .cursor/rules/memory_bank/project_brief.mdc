# Project Brief: Visitor Login Check System

## Core Purpose
This project provides a visitor management system that enables real-time verification of whether users are already registered in the Efficiency's (EC) database. The system serves as a check-in interface for visitors to determine their registration status before proceeding with their visit or related activities.

## Primary Objectives
1. **User Verification**: Provide a reliable mechanism to check if a visitor is registered in the EC database
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure the system is accessible on both mobile devices and desktop computers
3. **Seamless Integration**: Maintain a clean, minimal interface that integrates smoothly with the Google Apps Script backend
4. **User Experience**: Deliver a distraction-free, full-screen interface optimized for visitor check-in workflows

## Key Deliverables
- Responsive HTML wrapper page that works across all device types
- Integration with Google Apps Script backend for database queries
- Mobile-optimized viewport configuration
- Dark-themed UI for professional appearance

## Stakeholder Expectations
- System must be accessible at `visitors.efficiencys.com.sa`
- Interface must be intuitive and require minimal user training
- System must provide accurate, real-time database verification
- Performance must be sufficient for concurrent visitor check-ins

## Project Scope
**In Scope:**
- HTML wrapper page with responsive design
- Iframe integration with Google Apps Script backend
- Mobile and desktop optimization
- UI styling and theming

**Out of Scope:**
- Direct database access or modifications
- User authentication or session management (handled by Google Apps Script)
- Backend logic or database queries (handled by Google Apps Script)
- Additional features beyond visitor registration checking

## Absolute Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with the existing Google Apps Script URL
- Must preserve iframe functionality and attributes
- Must not interfere with the embedded application's functionality
- Must maintain responsive design principles
- Domain constraint: `visitors.efficiencys.com.sa`

## Success Criteria
- System successfully loads and displays the Google Apps Script application
- Interface is fully functional on mobile devices (phones and tablets)
- Interface is fully functional on desktop browsers
- No visual or functional regressions in the embedded application
- Fast load times and smooth user experience
